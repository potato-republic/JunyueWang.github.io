Master student at Cornell University. Proficiency in MySQL, Python, R, Apache Spark etc. Research interested in Healthcare system operations / Psychological Health Inference with Machine Learning / Natural Language Processing in application. 

I believe in power of data integrity and ETL automation process. As for now I have experience with data analytics and machine learning, I am looking to incorporate all these techniques in work to come up with integrated data solution.
